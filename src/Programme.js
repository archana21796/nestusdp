            <p className='fs-5 pt-3 col-9'>The Nest School offers a unique dual diploma programme that combines the

            students to achieve both the AS/A-Level diploma and the US High School Diploma
            within the same four-year timeframe, providing a comprehensive and globally
            recognized education.</p>
